why is a-sio2 fractal dimension 2.7? how do you measure fractal dimension of a structure? this will help figure out how to 
measure it for an atomistic structure? what does a-sio2 accumulation look like?


paper comments

"We apply a simple-cubic sine-type dispersion to confined acoustic vibrations to approximate
vibrational dispersion due to the tetrahedral orientation of bonds in certain dielectric materials."

First, I'm not sure you need to assume a simple-cubic crystal type to use a sine-type dispersion. For example, a sine-type 
dispersion describes a 1-D monatomic chain. I would just say simple sine-type, or something like that.

Why is a simple-cubic sine-type dispersion used "due to" the tetrahedrally-coordinated materials? I think  
that the psuedo dispersion of amorphous materials has been shown to follow a simple sine-type, at least at 
low-freq/low-wavenumber.  Examples are a-Si and a-SiO2. The pseudo-dispersion can be more complicated at large wavenumber, 
as you can see from Fig. 3 of my amorphous draft.
